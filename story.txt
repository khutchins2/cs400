Once upon a time, there was a village that had a very strange tradition. Whenever a villager needed to make a decision, they would not do it on their own. Instead, they would 
use a magic conch shell. This magic conch shell had a cord, and whenever that cord was pulled the shell would begin to speak and answer a question that the villagers  
had asked it. The villagers took its word as gospel, and would do whatever it said, even if the answer did not make any sense. However, one fateful day, a group of villagers 
became stranded in a kelp forest with the magic conch shell.

As the villagers did in times of trouble, they turned to the shell. “Oh great one” they chanted, “How do we escape the kelp forest?” The shell answered back, “Fly.” The villagers were confused. They had no wings and could not fly. But the shell was never wrong. The villagers began to think. How could they fly? Soon, one of the oldest villagers in the group sprang up yelling “I know how to fly!!” The other villagers listened intently while the elder shared his idea. “We must use the kelp” he said, “we must use the kelp as wings!”
