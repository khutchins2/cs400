Once upon a time, there was a village that had a very strange tradition. Whenever a villager needed to make a decision, they would not do it on their own. Instead, they would 
use a magic conch shell. This magic conch shell had a cord, and whenever that cord was pulled the shell would begin to speak and answer a question that the villagers  
had asked it. The villagers took its word as gospel, and would do whatever it said, even if the answer did not make any sense. However, one fateful day, a group of villagers 
became stranded in a kelp forest with the magic conch shell.
